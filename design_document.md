Game design principles:

- Armies cannot pass through enemy territory because this would cause chokepoints to be pointless, which would lessen the strategic depth of the game and make it less interesting.

- Armies should not pass through each other since that looks weird and counterintuitive. Also leads to gamey wild goose chases. Therefore if an army goes from A to B meets an enemy army from B to A then there should be a fight. In game, since armies in travel cannot be controlled, it is simply implemented that as soon as an expedition is created, it will check whether if it's going to collide with another expedition and the battle is done instantly.

- No simultaneous attack. Therefore there's no "tell all troops to arrive at the same time here" command. It's just too counterintuitive to have 5-9-5 beat the 9 as if it's the same as 10-9.
