Game design principles:

- Armies cannot pass through enemy territory because this would cause chokepoints to be pointless, which would lessen the strategic depth of the game and make it less interesting.

- Armies should not pass through each other since that looks weird and counterintuitive. Also leads to gamey wild goose chases. Therefore if an army goes from A to B meets an enemy army from B to A then there should be a fight. In game, since armies in travel cannot be controlled, it is simply implemented that as soon as an expedition is created, it will check whether if it's going to collide with another expedition and the battle is done instantly.

- No simultaneous attack. Therefore there's no "tell all troops to arrive at the same time here" command. It's just too counterintuitive to have 5-9-5 beat the 9 as if it's the same as 10-9.


Unit types:

- Principle: The primary choice that a player should focus on is how much resources to spend on attacking/defending where. This choice should be made as clear as possible. In other words, there should be an obvious way to spend resources to capture a location, same with to defend it. It should not be that if one player spends X amount of resources to capture a location, and the other player spends less resources but manages to beat the first player because of superior unit composition or micro or something like that. The only decision should be how much resources to spend on what objective, the particulars of how to spend those X resources to attain the objective is micro and tactics and not strategy. Therefore, rock-paper-scissors style unit types is bad for strategy.

- The game is fundamentally about the allocation and deallocation of resources. Armies are a type of resource, and are allocated to a zone in order to make that zone more expensive to capture for the enemy, and may be deallocated from a zone to make that zone easier to capture in exchange for making another zone harder to capture. Fortifications are a type of resource that, once allocated, cannot be deallocated. Non-mobile resources such as buildings therefore must be more cost effective than mobile resources such as armies in order to account for the fact that they cannot move.

- On nukes and offensive-only glass-cannon units. Nukes that can instantly win the game for you create a "whoever attacks first wins" type scenario. Similarly with glass cannon offensive-only units, where with two armies of offensive-only units, it's always the one that attacks first that wins.

- On fortifications and defensive-only guard units. Fortifications and strong defensive units create a "whoever attacks first loses" scenario. Strategic allocation of defensive units to areas where they are needed is therefore critical for discouraging enemy attack. However, as defensive units cannot attack, one cannot win by only building defensive units. This therefore creates a gameplay dynamic whereby players will build the minimum amount of defense necessary for maximal safe expansion. 





armies cost completely the same, but one beats the other, then the game is imbalanced.








Types of raw, "mineable" natural resources:

- In RTS games, the fact that there are different types of resources presents a choice for the player to choose which resource to gather based on his strategy, as well as forces the player to adapt his strategy to the resources available. If different types of units and buildings require different types of resources, then the type of resources available informs the player on what type of units and buildings he can build, and thus the player is forced to adjust his strategy accordingly. In the AOE series the resource of stone is implemented as an anti-turtling mechanic as fortifications cost stone which can only be found outside the player's base.

- However, scarcity of particular types of natural resources force "no brainer" decisions as you literally cannot build unit types that you cannot afford. In other words they artificially inflict restrictions on what types of units and buildings the players are able to afford.

- The fact that locations containing raw natural resources like stone and gold are strategically important can be substituted by other strategically important locations, such as unit spawn points, chokepoints,
